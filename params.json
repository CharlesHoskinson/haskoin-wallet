{"name":"Haskoin","tagline":"Bitcoin built by developers, for developers.","body":"### Welcome to the Haskoin project\r\nWe believe in building a better Bitcoin developer experience through the use of a pure and type-safe language: Haskell. Whether you use Haskell yourself or another language, our tools and APIs will get your project started in no time!\r\n\r\n#### Haskoin Node\r\nThe Haskoin node is a simple payment verification (SPV) node written in Haskell. SPV nodes have relaxed security checks compared to full nodes. They are meant to be used in applications where memory and CPU cycles are limited resources but where decentralization is important. The Haskoin SPV node will verify that block headers connect correctly and will trust that transactions are valid if they are linked to a block header through a partial merkle tree. Please head over here for a detailed explanation of SPV node security.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
